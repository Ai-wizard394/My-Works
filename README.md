## Introduction
Welcome to my repository! This collection showcases various projects and scripts that I have developed as part of my exploration in computer science. Each project serves a specific purpose, ranging from advanced proxy detection to speech recognition systems.

## File Descriptions
### Proxy_Detection.py
This script implements an advanced proxy detection system using Python. It utilizes machine learning models to detect unauthorized proxies during online assessments, ensuring exam integrity.

- You can find the code here: https://github.com/Ai-wizard394/My-Works/blob/main/Proxy_Detection.py.

### Speech_Recognition.py
This script demonstrates a speech recognition system developed in Python. It employs machine learning techniques to convert spoken language into text, suitable for applications like voice-controlled interfaces or automated transcription.
