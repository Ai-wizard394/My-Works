## Introduction
Welcome to my repository! This collection showcases various projects and scripts that I have developed as part of my exploration in computer science. Each project serves a specific purpose, ranging from advanced proxy detection to speech recognition systems.

## File Descriptions
### Proxy_Detection.py
This script implements an advanced proxy detection system using Python. It utilizes machine learning models to detect unauthorized proxies during online assessments, ensuring exam integrity.
The documentation of code can be found here: https://github.com/Ai-wizard394/My-Works/blob/main/Proxy_Detection_Documentation.pdf

- You can find the code here: https://github.com/Ai-wizard394/My-Works/blob/main/Proxy_Detection.py.

### Speech_Recognition.py
This script demonstrates a speech recognition system developed in Python. It employs machine learning techniques to convert spoken language into text, suitable for applications like voice-controlled interfaces or automated transcription.
